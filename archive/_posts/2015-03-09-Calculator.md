The last design project I did at UBC was a small app running on a Beaglebone Black microcontroller, interfacing with a few motors and other hardware. Throughout the project I was often ssh'd into the beaglebone, editing and compiling code directly on the microcontroller and I was constantly annoyed by having to take my hands off my laptop keyboard to use a calculator (base conversion, deriving constants to feed the pwm motor code).

So after my class projects ended I decided to take a week before exams and write a small command line calculator app!

The CLC is now mostly complete, with only a few more features to implement before I bump it up to V1.0. You can find more info on it and download it via github! [github.com/scoult3r/clc](https://www.github.com/scoult3r/clc)
