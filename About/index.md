##My Name is Sam Coulter
I am a senior year Computer Engineering (Software Option) student at the University of British Columbia. This is my website.

If you want to know more about me professionally, check out my [CV Page]({{site.url}}/CV/index.html) for a link to my resume and github account where you will find some cool software I have worked on. I am currently seeking employment, starting after I graduate at the end of April 2015. I am interested in Real Time Systems, Computer Graphics (and Games!), Embedded Systems, and Low Level Networking.

If you want to know more about *ME* me, you could read [my blog]({{site.url}}index.html) I suppose.
